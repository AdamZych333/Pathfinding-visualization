# Pathfinding algorithms visualizer

My first web app written using Angular 14. There are implemented algorithms: A*, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra. You can place walls that algorithm has to avoid and set starting and ending points of the path. If you want to you can generate maze which is created using randomized prim's algorithm.
You can access it on https://adamzych333.github.io/Pathfinding-visualization/.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
